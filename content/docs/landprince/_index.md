While a [landchad](/docs/landchad) owns the services he is hosting on the
Internet, the landprince is too busy doing more important things to concern
himself with [Nginx reverse
proxies](/docs/landchad/gitea/#setting-up-a-nginx-reverse-proxy), [writing
systemd
services](/docs/landchad/ergo/#surviving-restarts-with-a-systemd-service), and
other such banal things. And for what? He is not known for his Internet
services. However, he is not an unrefined man: he understands the money he
saves by self-hosting, instead of paying for a premium for a service that he
can set up himself.

## The answer: IaaS

While hosting in the cloud is indeed not truly self-hosting, since you do not
own the hardware that the service runs on, there are still fair reasons to
deploy what you want through an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud:

- You pay only the infrastructure fee that the cloud host asks for, as opposed
to third-party services that want payment for... well, the service.
- You tailor your solutions to what you want.
- Some cloud solutions are on a consumption basis, rather than provision basis;
you pay only for what you use, not simply for the period of provision.

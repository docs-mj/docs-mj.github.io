Hopefully by now you won't have to be sold on the invasive practices that
social media companies conduct. Websites such as Facebook and Twitter aquire so
much data on users that they often know more about you than you know about
yourself. The simple solution to this is to not use social media. However, that
just isn't an option for most people. So the next best thing is to setup a
self-hosted and federalised social media site so that you have full control
over your data. The contributor previously made [a video showing all the steps
in depth if you want to check it
out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7mVsLSsotU). If you run into any issues,
it is recommended to look at the video.

You'll need a server or VPS. You'll also need a domain name pointing to your
server's IP address [which is explained in this tutorial.](../get_a_website)

## Installation

### Setting Up and Configuring

First things first you'll need to make sure that you've hardened you
SSH so that password authentication is disabled. There's a great tutorial on
how to do this [which can be read here](../maintenance/ssh).

> [!WARNING]
> You will also want to do some other server-hardening measures with time,
> especially if your platform were to become mainstream. If there are large
> amounts of data going in and out of your server on a dynamic platform such as
> Pleroma, you will want to make sure no malicious data can exploit your
> system, or your personal data gets extracted without your consent. Explaining
> this in full detail is beyond the scope of this landchad guide, but you
> should be able to do this on your own eventually.

Next we'll install the required packages:

```fish
apt install curl unzip libncurses5 postgresql postgresql-contrib nginx libmagic-dev
```
  {{< /tab >}}

Next we'll install the required packages:

```fish
sudo dnf install curl unzip ncurses-libs postgresql postgresql-contrib nginx file-devel
```
  {{< /tab >}}

You can manually configure PostgreSQL to suit your system better. [Check
out the documentation
here](https://docs-develop.pleroma.social/backend/configuration/postgresql/)
and then run the below command:

```fish
systemctl restart postgresql
```

### Installing the Pleroma App

#### First as the root user

Pleroma is not in the Debian app repositories, so we will install it
manually. First create the Pleroma user by running the below command:

```fish
useradd -m -s /bin/bash -d /opt/pleroma pleroma
```

Then, still as root, we will create the required directories and give
the Pleroma user ownership of them.

```fish
mkdir -p /var/lib/pleroma/uploads
chown -R pleroma /var/lib/pleroma
mkdir -p /var/lib/pleroma/static
chown -R pleroma /var/lib/pleroma
mkdir -p /etc/pleroma
chown -R pleroma /etc/pleroma
```

#### Now, as the new Pleroma user

Now run `su -l pleroma` to login as the Pleroma user. Now use the `curl`
command below to download the Pleroma software and unzip it.

```fish
curl 'https://git.pleroma.social/api/v4/projects/2/jobs/artifacts/stable/download?job=amd64' -o /tmp/pleroma.zip
unzip /tmp/pleroma.zip -d /tmp/
```

Note that we are downloading the **amd64** version here. If you know you
have a different CPU architecture, replace that with whatever your
architecture is.

```fish
mv /tmp/release/* /opt/pleroma
rmdir /tmp/release
rm /tmp/pleroma.zip
./bin/pleroma_ctl instance gen --output /etc/pleroma/config.exs --output-psql /tmp/setup_db.psql
```

We need to briefly return to the root user so we can run the following
command (via the postgres user) to set up the database. Type <kbd>ctrl-d</kbd> or
run `exit` to return to the root user, then run:

```fish
su postgres -s $SHELL -lc "psql -f /tmp/setup_db.psql"
```

Then return to the pleroma user with `su -l pleroma` and we will test to
see that Pleroma can run:

```fish
./bin/pleroma_ctl migrate
./bin/pleroma daemon
```

That will initialize Pleroma. It might take as long as a minute to get
started, so wait a bit, then run the following:

```fish
curl http://localhost:4000/api/v1/instance
```

If everything is working, this command will give you a long line of
messy output. If it is not, you will get a connection error message.
Once it is working successfully, stop the Pleroma daemon and we will
interface Pleroma with the web server.

```fish
./bin/pleroma stop
```

### Setup and Configure Nginx

Return again to the root user. Let's copy Pleroma's Nginx
configuration file from the template given in the installation and
enable it:

```fish
cp /opt/pleroma/installation/pleroma.nginx /etc/nginx/sites-available/pleroma.conf
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/pleroma.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/pleroma.conf
```

Edit the `etc/nginx/sites-available/pleroma.conf` file and replace
**example.tld** with your domain name.

We now have to get a SSL certificate to enable encryption, since we have
a model configuration that already includes SSL information, just use Certbot's
certificates to get the needed certificate. Once you've got your cert setup,
copy over the Nginx configuration with the below command:

Once everything, including your Cerbot certificate is ready, simply
reload Nginx with this command:

```fish
systemctl reload nginx
```

### Setting up the service

Pleroma itself runs as a systemd service similar to other things running on
your server like Nginx. To start the service up run the below commands:

```fish
cp /opt/pleroma/installation/pleroma.service /etc/systemd/system/pleroma.service
systemctl start pleroma
systemctl enable pleroma
```

If everything worked then when you go to your domain in the web browser
you should see a bare-bones Pleroma instance.

### Creating an admin user

You'll be able to create new accounts on the Pleroma instance in the
login section on the website but the easiest way to setup an admin
account is with the CLI. Simply run the below command replaced with your
username:

```fish
su -l pleroma
./bin/pleroma_ctl user new username username@example.org --admin
```

{{% details title="What is a landchad?" closed="true" %}}

In times before the modern Internet, nerds on the Internet had their own land.
They ran their own [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat),
[BBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system), and
[Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) servers. Back then, those were
really powerful systems that ordinary people hosted within their homes to host
messages, forums, and files for hundreds of thousands of users around the
globe. They were the landchads; aristocrats of the Internet.

The power was within their own hardware and they made their own service. They
did not need to pay any Californian company or seek their approval to operate
on the Internet. They were the operators; the landchads. In a way, they *were*
the Internet.

The aformentioned systems were used to big effect, before corporations realised
they could force their square peg through the round hole that was HTTP, and tap
into the market of technically unskilled people. Today, those people only need
to open up their web browser to do everything that the nerds needed swathes of
software and configuration files for. The landchads of the IRCs and Usenet had
their lands dry up as the corporations built dams and irrigated their own land.
They were cast aside and many became Internet peasants as a result.

**You** can be the new generation of landchads. Arguably it is even easier now
to set up powerful services than it was to set up an IRC or BBS server back in
the day. You can be the landchad who owns his part of the Internet. **All you
need is one lazy afternoon to spare on tinkering at your computer**, and you
will have a working website, chat service, and maybe even more.

## Getting started

{{< callout emoji="✒️ " >}}
Most of what you will see will be a rehash or direct copy of content from
[LandChad.net](https://landchad.net/), a website by [Luke
Smith](https://lukesmith.xyz/), dedicated to the same goal of turning Internet
peasants into landchads. However, I will be providing my own twist where I
found something interesting that's not covered on that site already.

Many services you might want to set up depend on a domain name (e.g.
`maxwelljensen.eu`), so it is advisable to start with setting up your own domain
name and website. This costs pocket change and **can take as little as one
hour** to do. Click on the card below to get started.

### Beyond this guide

Of course, we cannot do the world of self-hosting justice with only this one
website. The world of free software is a huge one, so it is simply beyond our
ability to document all of it here. However, we hope this is a good start for
the Internet peasants to get themselves immersed into this world. Here are some
further pointers to get yourself properly established as a landchad.

Of greatest interest to you would probably be Awesome-Selfhosted, which is a
huge repository of all free software (with some exceptions) for self-hosted
services. Anything from wiki engines to password managers, you can host it
yourself, and Awesome-Selfhosted lists pretty much all of it.

# MJ Docs

This is my documentation website (https://docs.maxwelljensen.eu/) where I host
articles, showcasing knowledge that I learned, which nobody else may or may not
have documented before.

It is created using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a very simple and easy static
website generator.

If you are here to contribute, then feel free to open an issue or leave a
comment on the website itself. I also have my blog at
https://maxwelljensen.eu/.
